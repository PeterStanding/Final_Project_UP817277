Final Year Project

Description
------------
I have been coding this application since mid September, which is why there are little commits to the reposity. Upon creation of the repository, the KS1 game is mostly completed, with only a few bug fixes to test and resolve. The next steps are to make the application aesthetically pleasing for the younger audience, and to plan how to complete the second game. 

The KS1 game is a simple snap game, where the students will need to match ythe sum to the correct answer on the back of playing cards. Once the student has revealed two cards that match they will remain face up for the student record their progress and show where they are at within the game. However, when one the of the cards do not match the sum that the studnet has selected the entire board is reset. This aspect will enhance the students memory and recalling ability.

The KS2 Game is a bit more complicated. The students will be tasked with completing a set number of questions in order to fill up the fuel gauge on a rocket ship, allowing it to take off. If the student is successfull, the rocket will take off and they move onto the next level, which will be slightly harder. As the students get further into the game and the different planets, they will be challenged more with harder questions to complete to complete the launch. 

This Application is being devleoped to as part of my fina;l year projedct in order to try and improve engagement with mathematics at within the school environment.
As Maths is a large topic area and the interaction with childen and maths can be measured at a multitude of stages, I have chosen to focus primarily at the KS1 and KS2 year groups.
The main application is separated into 3 different sections - the profile page, KS1 page and KS2 page. Theb Profile page allows the students to keep track of their progress within the developed games and to pereosnalise the avatar from one of my created instances.
The other two pages are acting as a divide between the two different Key Stages.
This allows for a distinct difference between the key stages and the connected games referring to them.

Currently the log in information consists of dummy data in 4 different text files. These contain the names, passwords, schools and the avatars that the children have chosen.
The Login function works by reading the text files as a list of Strings and searching the list for the first instance of the students name. If this is successful, the index number is then used to check the other files and if all the inputs match that in the text files than the user is granted access to the application.

Code Environment
----------------
The Code is being completed within the Netbeans Jave IDE. Therefore in order to run the code the user will need to have access to this IDE and run the project. Java is my preferred language to code in, and it allows me to achieve the goals that I am setting out to complete.
